# Master_Thesis_ImageJ_Macros
ImageJ macros used for quantitative image analysis in my Master's thesis

Code Live/Dead:
Single macro to determine the cell viabiliy of cells stained with Ca-AM and EtHD1. 

Code SIM_analysis:
Three-step macro pipeline:
1) SIM _analysis_Image Processing for Radial profile.ijm --> used for image processing before measurement 
2) SIM_analysis radial profile ROI --> used to always apply the same ROI 
3) SIM_analysis Radial_Profile --> used to measure the Radial profile and Average Mean Intensity 

Tested with Fiji ImageJ version 2.9.0.
